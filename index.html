                Hello, I'm Desmond Wareham, a full-stack developer based in Atlanta, Georgia.

                <h1 class="text-center">About Me</h1>

                <p>
                    I have always had a passion for technology. I am currently enrolled in Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program, where I am learning to build full-stack applications individually and remotely with a team using React, JavaScript, Node.js,and SQL, and deploying with services such as Zeit and Heroku. In my past life I worked as a production assistant for film, television, and events. When I am not coding I am reading or making music.

                        <p><b>Quiz App</b></p>
                        <p>Test Your Game of Thrones Knowledge with my very first app, built with a minimalist design using jQuery, HTML and Vanilla CSS. The purpose of this project was to experiment with form and event handling, as well as to program as a team. I had to develop my technical ability in addition to communication, managing a tight deadline and compromising with a complete stranger. The content of this quiz came as a direct result of compromise. Game of Thrones served as an ice breaker and something that we both were interested in. This Game of Thrones Quiz App is a simple quiz game built for both casual and hardcore fans.  </p>

It was developed with JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Knex.js, PostgreSQL, HTML5, and CSS3 as  a collaborative effort with a team of my peers with daily stand-ups reported to our team lead. I was the lead back-end engineer on this project. I built the router and services, database migrations, and integration tests for the the server. This project was developed and it greatly enhanced my communication, team work, leadership, organization, and familitatrity with SCRUM.</p>
